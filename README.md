## Skills

#### Problem solver

While at Amazon, I was given the broad remit to improve catalogue processes and was given autonomy over how I sought to achieve this. This was a daunting task as this was my first full-time job.
- To ensure I used my time effectively, I structured my time into three: 1) analyse problems and identify opportunities, 2) implement solutions that had the greatest impact and/or lowest cost, and 3) reflect by quantifying the impact and understanding any learnings that arose.

- one such case where this process was particularly useful was when offshoring vendor contacts relating to catalogue data to our overseas support teams
- by following this process, I was able to continuously deliver solutions in an iterative process based on which issues were the most frequent

#### Collaborator

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- While working as a catalogue support specialist at Amazon, I identified a problem with a major book vendor's data feed. After conducting research this was a long standing problem that had arisen due to miscommunication between the development and business teams.

- Bridging the problem involved working closely with three teams. I provided the tech teams with quantification of the business impact - this helped them appreciate the scale of the issue, distilling the problem into a clear set of problems and issues made it easier for the business team support in fixing the problem, and good communication with the external vendor was necessary to keep them well informed and help troubleshoot issues throughout the process.
- The work improved data quality on over 370000 titles and increased weekly profit by nearly £100k per month.
